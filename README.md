## Clone and build
For build project from sources you must install g++ and curl.  
For OS based on Debian you may do that with APT:  
```
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ libcurl4-openssl-dev git
```
If you use Windows OS you may do that with [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/):  
```
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-curl git
```
Cloning project and changing current directory:  
```
git clone https://github.com/KlimentLagrangiewicz/scld
cd scld
```
Building from source (Linux):  
```
make
```
Building from source (Windows):  
```
make windows
```
If building was ok, you can find executable file in `bin` subdirectory.
